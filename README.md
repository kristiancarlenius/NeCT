# NeCT: Neural Computed Tomography

NeCT leverages deep learning to improve computed tomography (CT) image quality, supporting both static and dynamic CT reconstruction. For dynamic (4D) CT, the temporal resolution approaches the time between subsequent projections.

## Installation

NeCT has been tested on **Windows** and **Linux** with the following dependencies:

| Package         | Version           | Notes              |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| python          | 3.11 \| 3.12      |                    |
| pytorch         | 2.4 - 2.7         |                    |
| CUDA            | 12.X              |                    |
| CMake (Linux)   | 3.24              | For tiny-cuda-nn   |
| C++17 (Windows) |                   | For tiny-cuda-nn   |

> **Recommended:** Use [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to manage your Python environment.
>
> - For video export, the `avc1` codec for `ffmpeg` is only available with conda. With uv, video export uses the `mp4v` codec. If video export using `avc1` is vital, use conda.
> - Tested with `python=3.11, 3.12` and `pytorch>=2.4,<2.8`.
> - To install for multiple compute capabilities, see [below](#install-multiple-compute-capabilities).

**Note:** Ensure `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` include the CUDA binaries as described in [tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/). If you encounter installation errors related to `tiny-cuda-nn`, check their [issues page](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/issues). Building binaries for both tiny-cuda-nn and NeCT may take several minutes.

### Uv Installation

If you don't have uv installed, follow the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). This will install pytorch with CUDA 12.4.

```bash
uv venv --python=3.12
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install git+https://github.com/haakonnese/nect[torch]
uv pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch --no-build-isolation
```

#### Custom PyTorch Version

To use a specific PyTorch version (2.4-2.7) visit the [PyTorch Installation Page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and install the desired PyTorch version into your uv environment. Then install NeCT with:

```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/haakonnese/nect --no-build-isolation-package torch
uv pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch --no-build-isolation
```

### Conda Installation

```bash
conda create -n nect python=3.12 -y
conda activate nect
conda install pytorch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 pytorch-cuda=12.4 lightning==2.1 conda-forge::opencv -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge -y
pip install -v git+https://github.com/haakonnese/nect
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch
```

### Install Multiple Compute Capabilities

To build for multiple compute capabilities (e.g., 60=P100, 70=V100, 80=A100, 90=H100), set these environment variables **before** installing NeCT:

```bash
export CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="60;70;80;90"
export CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=${CUDA_ARCHITECTURES}
export TCNN_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=${CUDA_ARCHITECTURES}
export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0"
export FORCE_CUDA="1"
```

## Demo

Demo scripts are in the [demo](./demo/) folder. The first time you reconstruct demo objects, projection data will be downloaded automatically.

## Data

All projections from the dynamic experiments are available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/16448474).

## GUI

The GUI for NeCT is based on the GPL licensed PyQt5 library. For that reason, the GUI is in a separate repository: [nect-gui](https://github.com/haakonnese/nect-gui).
